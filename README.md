This app will allow you to view NYC squirrel sightings, in both map and list format. You will also be able to view the details of each squirrel, identified by their unique squirrel ID. You may update, add and detail squirrel data. Management controls are available to load squirrel data into the app from an existing csv file, or export the app's squirrel data into a csv file.
